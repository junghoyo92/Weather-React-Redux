####Necessary Actions#####
Before running npm start, one will need to create an API_KEY from the openweathermap.org
5 day forecast api. It is FREE!!! But it is also a necessary step to test the app.
Once you obtain a unique API_KEY, simply insert the key as instructed
in the src/actions/index.js file.
